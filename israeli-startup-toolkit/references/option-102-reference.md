# Option 102 - Israeli Employee Stock Options Reference

## Overview
Section 102 of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance provides a tax-efficient framework for granting equity compensation to Israeli employees.

## Three Tracks

### 1. Capital Gains Track (Trustee) - MOST COMMON
- **Holding period:** 24 months from grant date
- **Tax rate:** 25% capital gains tax on entire gain
- **Employer deduction:** None
- **Trustee:** Required (ITA-approved)
- **Best for:** Most startups (significant tax savings for employees)

### 2. Income Track (Trustee)
- **Holding period:** 12 months from grant date
- **Tax rate:** Up to 50% (marginal income tax rate)
- **Employer deduction:** Yes (company deducts the expense)
- **Trustee:** Required (ITA-approved)
- **Best for:** Companies with profits that benefit from tax deduction

### 3. Non-Trustee Track
- **Holding period:** None
- **Tax rate:** Up to 50% (marginal income tax rate)
- **Trustee:** Not required
- **Employer deduction:** Yes
- **Best for:** Rarely used; only when trustee setup is impractical

## Section 3(i) - Non-Employees
- For consultants, advisors, board members
- No special tax benefit
- Taxed as regular income (up to 50%)
- No trustee or holding period

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Draft ESOP
- Engage Israeli employment/tax lawyer
- Define plan terms:
  - Option pool size (typically 10-15% of company)
  - Vesting schedule (standard: 4 years, 1-year cliff)
  - Exercise price (usually fair market value at grant)
  - Trustee selection
  - Termination provisions

### Step 2: Select Trustee
**ITA-Approved Trustees:**
| Trustee | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Bank Leumi Trust | Largest bank trustee |
| Bank Hapoalim Trust | Major bank trustee |
| IBI Trust | Independent trust company |
| Altshuler Shaham | Investment house trustee |
| Meitav Dash | Investment house trustee |

**Typical fees:**
- Setup: 5,000-15,000 NIS
- Annual per participant: 500-1,500 NIS
- Transaction fees on exercise/sale

### Step 3: File with ITA
1. Submit plan document to local tax office (pakid shuma)
2. 30-day objection period begins
3. ITA may request modifications
4. Plan effective after 30 days if no objection
5. Keep ITA approval letter

### Step 4: Grant Options
1. Board resolution approving each grant
2. Employee signs option agreement
3. Notify trustee of grant details
4. Trustee records deposit

### Step 5: Vesting
- Standard: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- Cliff: No shares vest until 12-month anniversary
- Monthly vesting after cliff: 1/48 per month
- Acceleration clauses (optional): Single/double trigger on acquisition

### Step 6: Exercise and Sale
1. Employee decides to exercise (pays exercise price)
2. Trustee verifies holding period compliance
3. If holding period met: 25% capital gains tax
4. If holding period NOT met: Up to 50% income tax
5. Trustee withholds tax and remits to ITA

## Tax Calculation Example

```
Grant date:     January 1, 2024
Exercise price: $0.10/share
Shares granted: 10,000
Sale price:     $10.00/share (at exit)

Total gain: (10.00 - 0.10) x 10,000 = $99,000

Capital Gains Track (24-month hold):
  Tax: $99,000 x 25% = $24,750
  Net: $74,250

Income Track (12-month hold):
  Tax: $99,000 x 50% = $49,500
  Net: $49,500

Difference: $24,750 saved with Capital Gains Track
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Early departure:** If employee leaves before holding period, gains taxed as income
2. **Missing filing:** Plan must be filed with ITA before first grant
3. **Wrong track selection:** Capital gains track is almost always better for employees
4. **Trustee delays:** Allow 2-4 weeks for trustee setup
5. **Foreign employees:** Section 102 only applies to Israeli tax residents
6. **102 vs 3(i):** Consultants and advisors cannot use Section 102
